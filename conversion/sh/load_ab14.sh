# This script loads the AB_0014 FRI data into PostgreSQL

# The format of the source dataset is shapefile divided into mapsheets.

# Note that FRI data were originaly stored in the "polygon" feature class within the Coverage 
# feature plus an external info table object for each mapsheet. Unfortunately, external info tables 
# were not supported by GDAL. We used Python and the arcpy library to recover through a join the 
# attributes from the external info table and saved them in shapefile format for each mapsheet. 
# The original data are stored in data/archive
# 

# Script loops through each mapsheet and appends to the same target table in PostgreSQL.
# Done using the -append argument. 
# Note that -update is also needed in order to append in PostgreSQL. 
# -addfields is not needed here as columns match in all tables.

# The year of photography is included as a shapefile. 
# Photo year will be joined to the loaded table in PostgreSQL

# Load into the ab14 target table in the schema defined in the config file.

# If the table already exists, it can be overwritten by setting the "overwriteFRI" variable 
# in the configuration file.

# Set -overwrite for first load if requested in config
# After first load, remove -overwrite and add -update -append
# Two fields (FOREST# and FOREST-ID) don't load correctly because field names are not valid in PostgreSQL. Create two new columns (forest_id_1 and forest_id_2) with valid field names to hold these variables.
# Original columns will be loaded as forest_ and forest_id, they will be NULL because ogr2ogr cannot append the values from the invalid field names.
# New fields will be added to the right of the table
