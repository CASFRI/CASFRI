# This script loads the British Columbia VRI forest inventory (BC10) into PostgreSQL

# This dataset is split into 3 geodatabases, layer 1, layer 2, and a dead layer

# The year of photography is included in the attributes table (REFERENCE_YEAR)

# Load into a target table in the schema defined in the config file.

# If the table already exists, it can be overwritten by setting the "overwriteFRI" variable 
# in the configuration file.

# All three source tables have the same attributes, and the same polygons.
# There are therefore 3 records per polygon.
# We need a flat source table with one attribute per row.
# Load the three tables into PostgreSQL, prefix all attribute  names
# to have the prefix L1_, L2_ or D_. This way all tables will have unique attribute.
# Then merge the three tables into one final source table using ogrinfo and -sql.
