# CASFRI Specifications

The CASFRI Specifications document and accompanying tables reside in this folder. The original Specifications were written by John Cosco in 2009 and revised in 2011. We have translated the 2011 version to markdown format (cas_document_feb2011.md) and have created a "live" version of the document which can be edited by CASFRI team members (cas_document.md). Currently, the following files are available for viewing or downloading:

  * [CAS Specifications - main document (live working copy)](cas_document.md)
  * [CAS Specifications - main document (original Cosco version from Feb 2011)](cas_document_feb2011.md)
  * [CASFRI Specifications - appendices](cas_appendices.xlsx)
  * The "appendices" folder contain the appendices in CSV format and is currently incomplete.
  * The "attributes" folder contains more detailed information about attributes, including acceptable values, error and missing value codes, and miscellaneous notes. They are linked to the main document and currently only include a subset of the attributes.
