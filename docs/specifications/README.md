# Introduction

The CASFRI Specifications document and accompanying tables reside in this folder. The original Specifications were written by John Cosco in 2009 and revised in 2011. We have translated the 2011 version to markdown format and created a current version of the document which includes revisions and edits. The main documents include:

  * [CAS specifications (current version, markdown format)](cas_specifications.md)
  * [CAS specifications (current version, html format)](https://edwardsmarc.github.io/CASFRI/specifications/cas_specifications.html)
  * [CAS inventories (current version)](cas_inventories.md)

Archived documents:

These documents were converted from the original Cosco 2011 document to markdown (main doc and appendices 9 & 15) and Excel formats (appendices). The Excel worksheet can be converted to individual csv files as needed.

  * [Original CASFRI specifications document (Cosco 2011)](archive/cas_specifications_feb2011.md)
  * [Original CASFRI specifications appendices (Cosco 2011)](archive/cas_appendices_feb2011.xlsx)
