# CASFRI Specifications

The CASFRI Specifications document (Cosco 2011) was converted to Google docs for ease of maintenance and updating. It is thus considered to be a "live" document which can be edited by CASFRI team members. There are still some formatting issues to be resolved as well as a few appendices that need to be added. The pages can be found here:

Note that there is also a draft bookdown version of the document which is no longer maintained since the Google docs version is more efficient in terms of updating.
