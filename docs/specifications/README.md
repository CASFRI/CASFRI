# CASFRI Specifications

The CASFRI Specifications document (Cosco 2011) was converted to Google docs for ease of maintenance and updating. It is thus considered to be a "live" document which can be edited by CASFRI team members. There are still some formatting issues to be resolved as well as a few appendices that need to be added. The pages can be found here:

  * [CAS Specifications - main document in md format](cas_document.md)
  * [CAS Specifications - main document in html format](https://edwardsmarc.github.io/CASFRI/specifications/cas_document.html)
  * [CASFRI Specifications - appendices](cas_appendices.xlsx)
