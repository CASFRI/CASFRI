### CAS_ID


The CAS_ID is created by concatenating existing and modified attributes. For example, for the BC_0008 inventory, the CAS_ID would look something like this: "BC_0004-VEG_COMP_LYR_R1-xxx082C095-0000000001-0000001". The string can be broken down into its components (taken from CA_04 Python code):

  * prefixName - inventory name that starts with province code e.g., BC_000
  * HEADER_ID - unique number indicating inventory standard e.g., takes value of 4, 5, or 6 in BC
  * tblName - name of inventory dataset e.g., VEG_COMP_LYR_R1_POLY
  * MAP_ID - mapsheet identification based on a regular grid
  * SOURCE_OBJECTID - ?
  * OBJECTID - generated by ArcGIS
